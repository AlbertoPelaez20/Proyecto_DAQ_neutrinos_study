2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CI1/FMS00/Load_R_prev[4]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
CI1/muestra_ready_reg[0], CI1/muestra_ready_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt[7]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[0], CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[1],
CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[2], CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[3],
CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[4], CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[5],
CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[6], CI1/TIMER1/Count0/t_cnt_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt[7]_i_3__0 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[0], CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[1],
CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[2], CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[3],
CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[4], CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[5],
CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[6], CI1/TIMER2/Count0/t_cnt_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CI1/TIMER3/Count0/t_cnt[7]_i_3__1 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
CI1/TIMER3/Count0/t_cnt_reg[0], CI1/TIMER3/Count0/t_cnt_reg[1],
CI1/TIMER3/Count0/t_cnt_reg[2], CI1/TIMER3/Count0/t_cnt_reg[3],

PLHOLDVIO-2#5 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt[7]_i_3__2 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[0], CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[1],
CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[2], CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[3],
CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[4], CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[5],
CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[6], CI1/TIMER4/Count0/t_cnt_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port I2C[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
